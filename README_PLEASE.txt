Design Pattern: MVC with Router and auto-generated Models
Folder Structure:
  - root (this folder)
    - bin
    - controllers
      - API
      - web
    - middlewares
    - models
    - public
      - css
      - js
      - images
    - routes
    - views

Folder Structure Explanation:
  - bin:
    > contains all the executables (you don't need to touch this folder)
  - controllers:
    > contains all the controllers
    > separated by API and web
  - middlewares:
    > contains all the middlewares
    > register your middlewares here inside function in index.js
  - models:
    > contains all the models (you don't need to touch this folder, but you can add your models here)
    > is automatically generated by prisma (see explanation below)
  - public:
    > contains all the static files
    > these files are served by the server
  - routes:
    > contains all the routes
    > register your API routes in api.js
    > register your web routes in web.js
  - views:
    > contains all the views

Prisma auto-generated models explanation:
  - prisma automatically generates a model for each table in your database when you run `npx prisma pull`
  - the model is automatically generated by prisma (depends on your database)
  - generated models are stored inside prisma.schema in models folder
