## Folder Structure Explanation

- bin:
  > contains all the executables (you don't need to touch this folder)
- controllers:
  > contains all the controllers

  > separated by API and web
- middlewares:
  > contains all the middlewares

  > register your middlewares here inside function in index.js
- models:
  > contains all the models (you don't need to touch this folder, but you can add your models here)

  > is automatically generated by prisma (see explanation below)
- public:
  > contains all the static files

  > these files are served by the server
- routes:
  > contains all the routes

  > register your API routes in api.js

  > register your web routes in web.js
- views:
  > contains all the views

## Prisma auto-generated models explanation

- prisma automatically generates a model for each table in your database when you run `npx prisma pull`
- the model is automatically generated by prisma (depends on your database)
- generated models are stored inside prisma.schema in models folder
